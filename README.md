### DESCRIPTION

ReSi stands for Reduction Simulation

In this project, we simulate the process of data packet transmission in a data center network

 - [Android Project ReadMe template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)
 - [Web project template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)
 - A General contibutions guide in each project

### BACKGROUND

The following two research papers explain the ideas behind this tool:
* [A Reduction Model For Simulating Large-Scale Interconnection Network], Nguyen Tien Thanh, Nguyen Khanh Van, Bui Manh Cuong.

* [A scalable, commodity data center network architecture], Mohammad Al-Fares, Alexander Loukissas, Amin Vahdat.

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

1. All the files are in markdown format. While it is good to learn markdown. It is always great to have the [Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) bookmarked somewhere in your browser.

2. There are different Markdown templates for each type of project as below: 
    * [Android](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)- For android focused ReadMe
    * [Website](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)- For websites with HTML, CSS and JS
    * IOS ...coming soon - FOr IOS projects
    * Scripts ....coming soon - For Python, JS type projects
    * brief ...coming soon - TLo edit, this is a minimal version

3. Copy the respective files depending on the type of project. Paste it and edit the file.

4. As a general rule, provide link to download the app if its published on the playstore /website if it is hosted at the description section above.See image below

### Roadmap
  üöß üë∑‚Äç ‚õè üë∑ üîßÔ∏è üöß
- [x] Create An Android Projects ReadMe.
- [x] Create a website ReadMe for Html and css and JS projects.
- [ ] Creat a Scripts ReadMe file for Python, php, js type projects
- [ ] Create a ReadMe file for IOS projects

I would love to have your help in making  **readMe master templates** better.

The project is still very incomplete but under development. If there's an [issue](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/issues) you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/issues),

    or JUST,

- [Fork the project and send a pull request](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/pulls).
